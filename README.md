# Data-clustering-programs
This repository contains python implementation various clustering algoruithms like Fuzzy C- Means (FCM), Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM), Rough Fuzzy C-Means (RFCM), Rough Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (RIFCM) along with their kernelized versions (Gaussian and Hyper-tangent kernels), combined with firefly algorithm as a meta-heuristic. This project aims to enhance the efficiency of the existing clustering algorithms and also improve their convergence rate.
